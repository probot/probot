If you've ever thought, "wouldn't it be cool if GitHub could…"; imma stop you right there. Most features can actually be added via [GitHub Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/), which extend GitHub and can be installed directly on organizations and user accounts and granted access to specific repositories. They come with granular permissions and built-in webhooks. Apps are first class actors within GitHub.

**Probot is a framework for building [GitHub Apps](http://developer.github.com/apps) in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**. Check out some of the [featured apps](https://probot.github.io/apps) or [read the docs](https://probot.github.io/docs/) to learn more about writing a new app.

## Contributing

Probot is built by people just like you! Most of the interesting things are built _with_ Probot, so consider starting by [writing a new app](https://probot.github.io/docs/) or improving one of the [existing ones](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aprobot-app&type=Repositories), and check out our [contributing docs](CONTRIBUTING.md) for other ways to get started.
